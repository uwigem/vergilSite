Point2D Spec notes

There are no constructors because constructors cannot be declared in 
interfaces

In the method signatures where the return value or parameters were obvious,
I did not restate them with the @param or @return tags

I specified the pre and postconditions of the set precision methods, with the
@pre and @post tags

The set precision methods say "up to" that level of precision, but makes no 
guarantees that the actual precision will not be less. i.e. the user is setting
a max level of precision, which will make it easier to read

I put the @Override tag before methods that are being overrided from their 
previous implementation. Methods can be overrided without this, but if you put
it there, Java will throw an error if a method was **not** overriden, meaning
that you made a mistake in thinking that method was already defined somewhere else
